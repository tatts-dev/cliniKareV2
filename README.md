Clini-Kare, the solution me and the team built for the SMU Digital health hackathon
The purpose of Clini-Kare+ is to shorten the time it takes for sick patients to get help. Instead of waiting in long queues or trying to explain everything during a short doctorâ€™s visit, patients can now report their symptoms online first. This helps doctors understand what might be wrong before the appointment starts
